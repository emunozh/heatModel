  abstract = {The existing building stock in European countries accounts for over 40{\%} of final energy consumption in the European Union (EU) member states, of which residential use represents 63{\%} of total energy consumption in the buildings sector. Consequently, an increase of building energy performance can constitute an important instrument in the efforts to alleviate the 5EU6 energy import dependency (currently at about 48{\%}) and comply with the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is also in accordance to the European Directive (EPBD 2002/91/EC) on the energy performance of buildings, which is currently under consideration in all 5EU6 member states. This paper presents an overview of the 5EU6 residential building stock and focuses on the Hellenic buildings. It elaborates the methodology used to determine the priorities for energy conservation measures (ECMs) in Hellenic residential buildings to reduce the environmental impact from 5CO26 emissions, through the implementation of a realistic and effective national action plan. A major obstacle that had to overcome was the need to make suitable assumptions for missing detailed primary data. Accordingly, a qualitative and quantitative assessment of scattered national data resulted to a realistic assessment of the existing residential building stock and energy consumption. This is the first time that this kind of aggregate data is presented on a national level. Different energy conservation scenarios and their impact on the reduction of 5CO26 emissions were evaluated. Accordingly, the most effective 5ECMs6 are the insulation of external walls (33--60{\%} energy savings), weather proofing of openings (16--21{\%}), the installation of double-glazed windows (14--20{\%}), the regular maintenance of central heating boilers (10--12{\%}), and the installation of solar collectors for sanitary hot water production (50--80{\%}).},

Undoubtedly, cities have a high level of complexity, especially considering problems related to obtaining suitable information about a building's energy performance and consumption. This study developed a methodology able to characterize the energy performance of the built environment in a city or neighbourhood and to evaluate the effects of different energy strategies. The methodology was designed to be as simple as possible, not time consuming and applicable to all Italian towns, as well as elsewhere, if basic building information are available; the main phases of the methodology were the collection and analysis of the available data about the built environment and the implementation of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) city buildings database. To test the developed tool, the city of Milan was considered as a case study. The authors hope that this methodology will be able to support energy policies at the urban level, taking into account the approaches of different stakeholders to develop low carbon models of settlements.},

Despite the numerous studies on energy conservation applications in buildings, current knowledge on the energy-related characteristics of the building stock still remains limited.

This work is based on a harmonised structure for European building typologies (TABULA) developed for residential buildings, but the methodology may be extended to the tertiary sector as well. National typologies are sets of model buildings with characteristic energy-related properties representative of a country's building stock. The model buildings are used as a showcase for demonstrating the energy performance and the potential energy savings from typical and advanced energy conservation measures (ECMs) on the thermal envelope and the heat supply system. The proposed Hellenic residential building typology is presented for the first time along with an assessment of various (ECMs) that are used for an estimate of the energy performance of building stock in Greece in an effort to meet the 9{\%} indicative national energy savings target by 2016.},

To date, the conventional approach to synthesizing the base-year population has been based on the iterative proportional fitting procedure. Two issues associated with this conventional approach are discussed: the first is often termed as the zero-cell-value problem, and the second is related to the inability to control for statistical distributions of both household- and individual-level attributes. Then, a new population synthesis procedure is presented that addresses the limitations of the conventional approach. The new procedure is implemented into an operational software system and used to generate synthetic populations for the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas. Validation results indicate that the new procedure can produce a synthetic population that more closely represents the true population than the conventional approach can. },

  abstract = {Abstract Climate change has a dual implication on the built environment: on one hand human settlements and buildings are vulnerable to the effects of changing climate and on the other hand the building sector has a significant climate change mitigation potential. The relevant sustainable development and building policies as well as the building design, construction and maintenance strategies should jointly respond both to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. What should city developers focus on in order to plan a sustainable and safe city in a changing climate? This paper provides answers to this question, presenting a bottom-up methodology based on a generalized building typology of the residential building stock in order to estimate the mitigation potential and vulnerability of the residential sector. During the research, a case study has been implemented in Hungary to assess the structural impacts and vulnerability on the roof, particularly with respect to the wind load and to estimate the potential decrease of 5CO26 emission through refurbishment. Through the case study the paper highlights the most problematic areas of the city both from vulnerability and mitigation point of view where the attention of the city developers should be turned.},

The building typologies focus on energy performance and can be used in the analyses of e.g. political strategies for planning the future upgrading of the energy performance of the residential building stock. Overall, the typologies consist of two types of building models - real example models and average designed models. Based on buildings selected from the database of the Danish Energy Performance Certificate Scheme, real example models were established that were found to be good representatives, which had not yet been through any major energy upgrading (except windows and doors), since they were erected. These real example model buildings can be used to promote energy-saving potential to homeowners. Another main purpose of developing the building typologies was to establish a tool able to calculate different energy-saving scenarios for the entire residential building stock. To make such calculations of scenarios, similar average designed building models were established based on extracted average values from the Danish Energy Performance Certification Scheme database. The two building typologies had the same overall composition, i.e. three main building types: Single-family houses, terraced houses and blocks of flats. Each main building type is presented for nine periods representing age, typical building tradition and insulation levels. Finally, an energy balance model of the residential building stock was devised to validate the average designed building models. Compared with the official statistics on energy consumption in Denmark 2010, the results showed a difference below 4{\%}, making it an applicable tool for scenario analyses of an upgraded energy performance of the Danish building stock.},

The early procedure developed for population synthesis involved the generation of a joint multiway distribution of all attributes of interest using iterative proportional fitting (IPF). Recognizing its limitations, including the inability to deal with multilevel controls, several alternate methods have been proposed in the last few years. This article presents a methodology called the fitness-based synthesis (FBS) that directly generates a list of households to match several multilevel controls without the need for determining a joint multiway distribution. The application and validation results demonstrate both the feasibility of the approach and its improved performance relative to the IPF and methods using fewer control tables. This article also presents a comprehensive validation of the synthetic populations against the true populations and thereby demonstrates the ability of the FBS method to generate the multidimensional correlations among the attributes. The number of iterations to terminations is found to be between one and three times the number of households to be synthesized. In sum, the FBS is an efficient and scalable methodology that is easy to implement and as such is a valuable tool for generating the detailed socioeconomic characteristics need for applying disaggregate travel-demand forecasting models.},

This papers presents rst eorts towards a tailored spatial microsimulation model that selects representative households from the micro census for a specic urban area tted to an aggregated cross tabular  demographic  information.  The  selected  families  are  allocated  to geo-referenced buildings of the corresponding urban area, see (Munoz Hidalgo & Peters, 2014).  The core of the paper deals with the generation of time schedules for the individual occupants based on their demographic characteristics.  In order to reproduce a plausible
time schedule for the buildings I use the offcial time-use survey from Germany "Zeitbudgeterhebung".   This  data  set  contains  detail  demographic  information  of  single families.  This information is used to allocate occupational schedules to families in the micro census. The time budget data set contains detail information about the time spend on specic activities.  The model generates a simplied sub-hourly time schedule identifying occupancy rates of individual families in the building.  This method opens the possibility to further investigate into several elds of application such as the use of demographic characteristics in:  (1) thermal simulation models or (2) heat balancing methods, which typically requires the historical prole of individuals and have  traditionally  been  dicult  to  acquire,  leading  the  community  to  perform  the simulation with standardized individuals.  The approach is applied to assess:  (1) the eects of user behaviour on heat consumption; and (2) the consequence of this eect in the performance of heat supply infrastructure.  The results of this simulation are
presented in this paper aiming to establish a discussion platform in both communities: the microsimulation community and the energy simulation community.},

  abstract =  {We present a comparison of two well established methods in the spatial microsimulation community to generate synthetic population
for small geographical areas: (1) GREGWT, a SAS macro developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and (2) IPF, Iterative Pro-
portional Fitting, probably the most used method among the spatial microsimulation community. We also present a new implementation of
the GREGWT algorithm in the R language in form of an R library. This new R library aims to replicate the SAS implementation of the
GREGWT algorithm.

In our analysis we test the performance of the three algorithms on four small areas of Germany. These areas correspond to the European statistical units NUTS-3. Aggregated statistics for these areas are available from the last German census (2011). The survey used in this analysis is a freely available micro census survey from the year 2010 and contains 3% of the original micro census survey (1% of the total population) from the same year. This survey contains 23, 374 records of German residents. We perform a reweighting of the initial weights from the survey using these three different methods. In our analysis we compare these results by means of: (1) Total Absolute Error (T AE); (2) Percentage Specific Absolute Error (P SAE), to measure the error between input benchmarks and estimated marginal sums; (3) Total Absolute Distance (TAD); and (4) Chi-squared distance, as measures of the difference between initial weights and estimated new weights.

A particular focus of this work is the attention paid to the weight distance minimization constraint implemented in the GREGWT algorithm
and the effect on the resulting new weights. In this paper, we also present the benefits of using the weight distance as an extra constraint. For some specific cases the use of this extra constraint may be useful, for example to maintain a known distribution from an aggregated geographical area. The results presented in this paper show a minimal TAE for all three implementation and a neglectable difference in the resulting weights between both implementations of the GREGWT algorithm. Results of the paper also show the sensitivity of these algorithms to a modification of the initial weights. The IPF algorithm shows a lower sensitivity to a modification of the initial weights by factor 10 compared to the GREGWT algorithm.

We conclude this paper by arguing a possible use of the model’s sensitivity to a modification of the initial weights within the design of spatial microsimulation models.},

Using the German microcensus (2010), which contains both detailed sociodemographic characteristics of individuals and detailed information on the type of buildings in which these individuals live, we can generate, at the NUTS-3 level, not only a synthetic population but also a synthetic building stock. The microcensus reports the construction year and number of dwelling units of the buildings in which
individuals live, allowing us to classify the buildings into a building typology describing specific heat demand per squared meter.
This procedure has two major advantages. For one, there exist many models in Germany for the estimation of heat demand at building level. A common problem with these is the great demand for building data, making the process very specific to site and simulation method used. With the microcensus as the only required data source we are able to estimate heat demand at a spatially disaggregated
level for the entire country. This generated microdata can be used in a second in combination with a local digital cadastre, reducing the spatial level to individual geo-referenced buildings. Moreover, the method is more easily transferable to other countries which tend to have less rich building data than Germany. Secondly, we can incorporate user behavior. Because the building stock in Germany — as
in most of Europe — is growing more efficient at a considerable pace, user behavior deserves a greater share of attention in building simulation. In light of this development, we see a justification for simplifying building simulation models with regard to building geometry, and enriching them with regard to user behavior which is barely part of building simulation yet.
We conclude our paper with an internal validation of the microsimulation model by means of the Total Absolute Error T AE and present the first results from this model aggregated at the NUTS-3 level for the entire country. We briefly discuss the observed patters of the results and attempt to hypothesize on the reasons behind this patterns. We also discuss the difficulties of an external validation of this model
and how we can address them in the future as well as the further development of our model.},

  abstract = {Spatial microsimulation modelling has developed for over a half century and is now a mainstream analytical tool within the microsimulation community accounting for a very significant proportion of papers at conferences and within the journal. There have been a number of recent surveys of “mainstream” spatial microsimulation models and associated methodologies. The contribution of this paper relates mainly in extending these surveys by considering other micro based simulation models that incorporate a spatial or geographic dimension. We feel this is important as in many areas of microsimulation modelling, there are parallel literatures that have developed that apply simulation techniques to micro units that are not labelled microsimulation or in the case of the papers reviewed in this paper not labelled spatial microsimulation. The paper reviews a number of different application areas of spatially focused microsimulation models, including demography, welfare, health, regional development, transport planning, agri-environmental analysis, crisis planning, land use and planning. We also review a number of the methodological choices made by modellers including scope, and spatial disaggregation, data sources, data creation methodology, validation and calibration and simulating change},

  abstract = {Built environment is responsible for 60{\%} of total energy consumption in European countries and 128 million 5BOE6 of primary energy in Belgium. The average energy consumption in the residential buildings of Belgium is 70{\%} higher than the 5EU6 average and stands at 348~kW~h/m2/year. Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) provides guidelines for energy performance analysis of buildings in Belgium. In this study, a holistic approach has been adopted to analyse the building stock of Liege, Belgium. This analysis is based on `General Socio-economic survey 2001' and `Housing quality survey 2006 in Walloon region' databases. It considers parameters such as buildings age, built-up area, type of heating system, type of fuel used, adjacency, insulation of roofs and walls and energy consumption etc. for an in depth analysis. This study concludes that about 69{\%} of buildings which are constructed before 1945 needs serious renovation towards the improvement of roof and external wall insulation level. It then successfully identifies specific areas which need detailed study to evaluate the comfort status in the existing building stock, improvement of insulation level and its effect on heating energy consumption as well as the economic analysis on energy efficiency measurements.},
